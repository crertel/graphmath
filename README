What is graphmath?
===================

Graphmath is a library for handling common 2D and 3D operations, usually with an eye towards vector arithmetic for graphics and simulation.

It's designed to be comfortable to use, reasonably fast, and something which will benefit game developers and graphics programmers, though it may also be useful for robotocists and anyone attempting large-scale simluations which exist in R2 or R3.

Features
========

* Addition, subtraction
* Element-wise multiplication
* Scalar multiplication
* Inner-products (dot product)
* Cross products
* Projection
* Normalization
* Comparison
* Rotation
* Linear interpolation


Conventions in library
======================

All mathematics are done in a right-handed coordinate system--that is to say, +Z is the cross-product of +X with +Y.

All vectors are (currently) stored as lists of numbers. Later version may add support for structs or other representation types.

All operations are accompied by tests and documentation.

---For developers---

1. Fork this project on Github.

2. Open an issue for your proposed changes.

3. Add tests for your new functionality, if applicable.

4. Add documentation for your functionality, if applicable. *NO DOCS -> NO MERGE*.

5. Submit a pull request.

6. Bask in the glory of having helped create content on one of the best platforms ever devised.

---For non-developers---

Wishlist
========

* Proper support for 4x4 rigid-body transofrms and mass-point math.

* C/SIMD native extennsions (probably want to live in a different, API-compatible library.

* Left-handed coordinate system support (don't care enough right now, but some interop would appreciate it).

* Fucntions to convery to packed 32-bit and 64-bit float byte arrays.

* Proper support for point-plane arithmetic

* Proper support for point-line arithmetic

* Proper support for point-point arithmetic
